                  <p>Phantom wallet beginners guide  Easiest guide to using the Solana web3 wallet. Here in this
                    tutorial
                    well show you how to setup Phantom wallet and how you can use it to send, receive, stake and
                    swap tokens on
                    the Solana blockchain. Additionally well also show you how to connect the Phantom wallet to
                    Solana Dapps and
                    explain how you can connect your Ledger hardware wallet to Phantom.</p>
                  <p>Now before we get into the guide here is a little bit information about Solana and the Phantom
                    wallet in case you
                    are new.</p>
                  <h3>Solana ecosystem</h3>
                  <p>Solana is one of the fastest growing ecosystem in the crypto space. Similar to Ethereum; Solana
                    also offers a vast
                    array of DApps and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) solutions. You have Solana Name Service similar to
                    ENS (Ethereum
                    Name Service), DeFi exchanges, Dapps andNFT marketplacesuch as Solana Art where you can buy or mint
                    your own NFTs.
                    There are even many play-to-earn Metaverse games on the Solana ecosystem.</p>
                  <p>To name some here are some of the popular projects on the Solana network.</p>
                  <p>Raydium, NFT Rarity, Serum, Solape swap, Solanart, Star Atlas, Ninja game, Aurory project and
                    Solana Monkey
                    Business.</p>
                  <p>So many companies, developers, gamers and artists are using the Solana ecosystem at the moment to
                    build their
                    projects. The reason is mainly because Solana is a highly scalable, fast and an efficient
                    blockchain.</p>
                  <p>Now to access the Solana platform and to get involved with projects on the Solana ecosystem you
                    need a Solana
                    wallet. Solana has many popular wallets like Solflare, Sollet, Solong, Slope and Phantom. But the
                    best one is the
                    Phantom wallet. Not only its the best Solana wallet but it is one of the best crypto wallets out
                    there.</p>
                  <p>Previously weve made a guide on the Solana SPL token wallet calledSollet. It is an open
                    source web wallet
                    for advanced users and developers. For the best Solana user experience and support, it is
                    recommended to use Phantom
                    wallet.</p>
                  <p>If youve traded on Ethereum or used the Binance Smart Chain then youll be familiar
                    withMetamask A simple, nice and clean browser extension. Now Phantom wallet is similar to
                    Metamask except it
                    has some extra built in features like for example: it has a separate tab where you can view and
                    mange all your Non
                    Fungible Tokens (NFTs). You can even view and inspect the 3 dimensional assets such as in game
                    collectibles right
                    from your wallet. The wallet fully renders both JPEGs and 3d in game assets. How cool is that?</p>
                  <h2>Phantom wallet</h2>
                  <p>Phantom is a non custodial crypto wallet of the Solana blockchain. This wallet allows you to manage
                    digital assets
                    and lets you access the world of decentralized applications on the Solana network. Using Phantom
                    wallet you can
                    store, send, receive, stake, swap tokens on the Solana blockchain. Also you can interact with
                    decentralized finance
                    (DeFi) apps, exchanges, Non-fungible token (NFT) platforms, and games on the Solana blockchain.</p>
                  <p>This wallet is readily available as a browser extension which you can install it on Firefox,
                    Microsoft Edge, Google
                    Chrome and Brave browsers. It has a smooth and modern user interface that is very similar to the
                    alternative web3
                    wallet metamask. You can turn any of your favorite browser into a Web3 enabled crypto wallet.</p>
                  <p>Phantom was only available as a browser extension initially. But now it is also available for the
                    iPhone which you
                    can download it from the App store. Everything you can do on desktop, you can now do it in your
                    pocket.</p>
                  <p>Install the Phantom wallet on your iPhone to store assets and access dApps on the Solana
                    blockchain. Using your
                    mobile wallet application you can deposit, transfer, stake, and swap assets on Solana easily. Not
                    only Solana but in
                    the near future itll even have support for other blockchains.</p>
                  <p>Here are few reasons to consider the Phantom wallet.</p>
                  <h3>Phantom features</h3>
                  <p>Phantom makes it safe  easy for users to store, send, receive, stake, and swap tokens on the
                    Solana
                    blockchain. It unlocks a simple and secure way to interact with blockchain-based decentralized
                    applications directly
                    from your web browser.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Here are some of the notable feature of the Phantom wallet  A non custodial wallet that
                      allows you to
                      send, receive, collect NFTs and swap tokens.</li>
                    <li>Web3 Support  Just like now metamask is for Ethereum; Phantom is for Solana. You can
                      explore the world of
                      decentralized blockchain applications built on Solana.</li>
                    <li>NFTs and Collectibles  Phantom wallet has a special tab that lets you take care of your
                      NFTs.</li>
                    <li>Token Swaps  Has its own built-in DEX (Decentralized Exchange) so you can safely swap
                      tokens at the best
                      prices, instantly.</li>
                    <li>SOL Staking  You can earn rewards by staking SOL (Solana) directly inside your wallet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ledger Support  To enhance the security you can also connect your Phantom wallet to your
                      hardware wallet
                      such as Ledger.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Phantom currently only supports the Solana ecosystem. But in the near future you can expect it to
                    work with
                    Ethereum and other blockchains. The developers are working on making the Phantom Wallet a
                    multi-chain wallet.</p>
                  <p>Alright! Lets now see how to create Phantom wallet and use it to store and mange Solana
                    tokens and NFTs.</p>
                  <h2>How to setup Phantom</h2>
                  <p>Creating Phantom Wallet: A step by step guide. Follow the guide below to install and use the
                    Phantom wallet.</p>
                  <p>Note: Phantom is a free application which is available as browser extension on desktop and for
                    iPhone. However the
                    following guide is only for desktop users which shows you how to install the Phantom extension on
                    your browser and
                    turn it into a web3 crypto wallet.</p>
                  <p>Phantom is similar to metamask in terms of functionality and usability. Also it is super simple to
                    setup and use.
                    Lets get started by installing the extension.</p>
                  <p>Note: Always download applications only from the official website.</p>
                  <p>Download Phantom<br />Visit https://phantom.app/download and youll find the links for
                    browser add-on and the
                    link for iOS app store.</p>
                  <p>Phantom Solana wallet app for iPhone: <a

                  </p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-desktop.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Select your browser type and it will take you to the web store. Here well be using Google
                    Chrome as an
                    example.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a1.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Click on add to chrome and add the extension. The steps are same for other browsers as well. After
                    clicking add
                    extension It will download the add-on to your PC and install it on your browser. In this case its
                    Chrome.</p>
                  <p>After the Phantom extension is installed on your browser it will auto open. Now before we create a
                    new wallet here
                    is how you can access Phantom on your browser.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a1.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>On most popular browsers youll see the extension / add-on at the top right corner. Also you
                    can look into
                    your browsers tool bar and add-on section. On Chrome at the top right corner youll see a
                    puzzle icon. Click
                    on it and youll see the list of installed extensions. Find the Phantom extension and click on
                    the &ldquo;pin
                    icon&rdquo;. Itll pin the extension at the top and this should make it easier for you to find
                    and access
                    Phantom in the future.</p>
                  <p>Now click on the Phantom icon and start the wallet setup.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a2.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <h3>Create new wallet</h3>
                  <p>Phantom app will start up in a new tab and youll find two options. 1. Create new wallet and
                    2. Use secret
                    recovery phrase.</p>
                  <p>Since we are setting up a brand new wallet choose &ldquo;create new wallet&rdquo;. If you are an
                    existing Solana
                    user and were previously using wallets like Sollet or Solflare then you can use your secret recovery
                    phrase to
                    import your existing wallet to Phantom  A crypto wallet reimagined for DeFi  NFTs.</p>
                  <h3>Import existing wallet</h3>
                  <p>To import wallet first find your secret recovery phrase from your existing wallet. The secret
                    recovery phrase can
                    either be 12 or 24 words depending on your current wallet. Here in this guide you can find how
                    toexport private key,
                    mnemonic from Sollet. Once you have your 12 or 24 word &ldquo;mnemonic&rdquo; or &ldquo;Secret
                    Recovery
                    Phrase&rdquo; click use secret recovery phrase option to import your current wallet. Next enter your
                    mnemonic secret
                    recovery phrase and click continue.</p>
                  <p>Thats it! After this step is successful you should see the Phantom wallet displaying all
                    your previous
                    addresses and its assets which it derived from your recovery phrase.</p>
                  <h3>New wallet setup</h3>
                  <p>Click create new wallet and on the next screen the wallet will generate and display the 12 word
                    secret recovery
                    phrase for you.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a3.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Now this part is crucial. The secret recover phrase is your wallet backup. Write it in a piece of
                    paper (order is
                    important) and keep it in a safe and secure location offline. Never take screen shot and never save
                    it online. To
                    restore your Phantom wallet in the future youll need this recovery phrase. In case if someone
                    gets access to
                    this or if you lose this then youll potentially lose all your funds you have in your Phantom.
                  </p>
                  <p>Okay, now once you have the seed words secured click &ldquo;OK, I saved it somewhere&rdquo;.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a4.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>On the next screen youll be asked to create a password which will be used to lock and unlock
                    your wallet.
                    Set a strong password. Next read and choose I agree to the the Terms of Service and then click
                    continue.</p>
                  <p>Youre all done! Your Phantom wallet is ready to use. Click Finish to complete the wallet
                    setup.</p>
                  <p><strong>Optional:</strong>For latest news and product updates you can follow Phantom on Twitter.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Twitter: https://twitter.com/phantom</li>
                    <li>Official website: https://phantom.app/</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Note:</strong>Beware of the scam andphishing bots on Twitter, YouTube and other social
                    media sites.
                    Remember at no point the developers or the support team of Phantom will ask you for your recovery
                    phrase. Hackers
                    main target is your seed phrase. Whoever has access to the phrase can access your funds. So keep it
                    safe and secure.
                  </p>
                  <p>Alright! Now that weve completed the Phantom wallet setup lets see how to how to send
                    receive tokens
                    and NFTs? How to connect to DApps and how to interact with the Solana ecosystem?</p>
                  <h2>How to use Phantom Wallet</h2>
                  <p>After completing the wallet setup this is how the wallet looks.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a5.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <h3>Deposit SOL  tokens</h3>
                  <p>First of all to start using the wallet you need some funds. Before you send any Solana (SPL) tokens
                    to your Phantom
                    wallet, send SOL  the native asset of the Solana blockchain. Because to perform any
                    transactions on the
                    Solana blockchain you you will need some SOL to pay for transactions fees. This is similar toETH
                    being used as gas
                    fee on Ethereumand BNB being used as gas fee on the Binance Smart Chain network.</p>
                  <p>Now to deposit SOL to you wallet you need to get your SOL address. At the top of the Phantom wallet
                    youll
                    find your wallet address. Click on it to copy it to the clipboard. If you need a QR code then click
                    deposit and
                    search for Solana. The wallet will display the address along with the QR code.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a6.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p><strong>Note:</strong>The address you see in your Phantom wallet is same for Solana and all other
                    SPL tokens. So
                    you can use the same address to receive SOL and SPL tokens to your Phantom wallet.</p>
                  <p>Now Solana is available on a number of exchanges including;FTX,BinanceandCoinbase. You can use any
                    of these
                    exchanges to buy SOL. But our recommendation isFTX. Why? Because by staking FTT on FTX youll
                    get free
                    withdrawals oncoins and tokens.</p>
                  <p>Okay, Once you acquire SOL from your favorite exchange go to withdrawal section, select withdraw
                    SOL and paste your
                    Phantom wallets Solana address which you just copied. Most exchanges auto detects the
                    network. When
                    transferring to your Phantom wallet just make sure you are transferring via the Solana network.Avoid
                    sending tokens
                    to the wrong network.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a7.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>After entering your wallet address, enter how much SOL youd like to withdraw and click
                    withdraw. After a
                    while youll receive SOL to your Phantom wallet address.</p>
                  <p>Additionally the wallet also provides you an option to Buy SOL with MoonPay. You can easily buy SOL
                    with debit,
                    credit card or bank transfer directly from your wallet. Or you can transfer SOL and SPL tokens
                    directly from your
                    FTX.us account. This option will connect your wallet to FTX exchange for easy transfers.</p>
                  <p>Other than CEX you also usecross chain DeFi bridgesto transfer tokens from one chain to another.
                    For example you
                    have Solana Wormhole, one of the most popular bridges connecting Ethereum and Solana blockchains.
                    But be cautions
                    and do your research when using bridges. Wormhole recently reported to be lost about $320 million of
                    ETH in an
                    apparent hack.</p>
                  <p>Learnhow to transfer / convert ERC20 tokens to Solana SPL tokens.</p>
                  <p>You can use the following Solanaexplorersto track your transaction.</p>
                  <p><a href="https://explorer.solana.com/" target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener">https://explorer.solana.com/</a></p>

                      rel="nofollow noopener">https://solanabeach.io/</a></p>
                  <p>After transferring SOL to your Phantom wallet you can use the same method to transfer any SPL
                    tokens. You can even
                    transfer pegged stable coins like USDC and USDT.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a8.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Just before transferring make sure to enable the token in your Phantom wallet. Here is how to
                    manage the token
                    list.</p>
                  <h3>Manage tokens</h3>
                  <p>On the wallet main screen click on deposit or select manage token list to manage Solana tokens.</p>
                  <p>Here youll find the list of tokens that you can add to your Phantom wallet. Not only SPL
                    tokens but
                    youll also find other blockchain pegged tokens which you can mange it using your Phantom
                    wallet.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a9.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Just search for the token name or find your favorite token by copy pasting the token contract
                    address in the search
                    bar and enable it. If you cant find your favorite token in the search list then youll
                    have to manually
                    the add custom tokens.</p>
                  <h3>Adding custom tokens</h3>
                  <p>Click on the + icon in the search field to add custom Solana tokens to your Phantom wallet. Its
                    just same as how
                    youadd custom tokens in metamaskand addedcustom tokens in sollet. All you have to do is find and add
                    the token mint
                    address which is the contract address, its name and the symbol.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a11.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>To find the token address use the Solana block explorers or the official token website. Beware of
                    fake tokens. We
                    suggest you to read thismetamask security tipswhich also applies to Phantom wallet.</p>
                  <p>Now to add token metadata that is the custom tokens to your Phantom wallet it will cost you 0.00204
                    SOL currently
                    and this is one time fee. After adding; the token will be permanently displayed under your account.
                  </p>
                  <p>Thats it! You can now start depositing any Solana based tokens to your Phantom wallet
                    address.</p>
                  <h3>Create new Phantom wallet address / account</h3>
                  <p>After setting up Phantom, the wallet displays your address at the top. You can use it to receive
                    SOL, SPL tokens
                    and even NFTs.</p>
                  <p>Instead of using one address for storing all your tokens you can use separate accounts / addresses
                    to manage your
                    tokens and NFTs.</p>
                  <p>Here is how you can create a new address in your Phantom wallet.</p>
                  <p>Click on the burger menu icon at the top left side of your Phantom extension. Itll display
                    your default
                    account / address. Just below that youll find the option to add / connect wallet.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a12.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Click Add / Connect wallet and on the next screen choose &ldquo;Create a new wallet&rdquo; to
                    instantly generate a
                    new wallet address. The wallet address which you just created is associated with your main seed
                    phrase.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a13.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Other than creating a new wallet you can also import an existing wallet by importing private key or
                    you can also
                    connect your hardware wallet.</p>
                  <p><strong>Note:</strong>We do not recommend import private key method because the private key that
                    you import
                    wont be associated with your wallet seed. Either create a new wallet or if you have a ledger
                    then connect
                    your hardware wallet. Hardware wallet adds a level of security.</p>
                  <p>Here lets see how to connect your Ledger hardware wallet to Phantom.</p>
                  <h3>Connect hardware wallet (Ledger)</h3>
                  <p>Like Metamask; Phantom also supports hardware wallet. But as of now it only supportsLedger. If you
                    got a Ledger
                    Nano device then you can store tokens and even NFTs on your Ledger Solana address. To send and
                    manage the Solana
                    assets you have to connect your Ledger to Phantom which will act as your hardware wallet interface.
                  </p>
                  <p>Connecting Ledger to Phantom is same asconnecting Ledger to Metamask.</p>
                  <p>We hope you have your Ledger device ready and its seed phrase secured. When using Ledger the
                    recovery phrase
                    generated by Ledger matters and not the one generated by Phantom. Anyways for safety reasons store
                    both the secret
                    recovery phrases safely.</p>
                  <p>To manage your Ledger wallet youll needLedger Live. Connect your device to PC and then using
                    Ledger Live
                    first install the Solana app on your device. Then keep the Solana app opened on your device.</p>
                  <p>Next open Phantom, go to add / connect wallet and choose connect hardware wallet. Phantom will then
                    start searching
                    for your hardware device.</p>
                  <p><strong>Note:</strong>To successfully connect Ledger and Phantom you need to keep the Solana app
                    open before
                    connecting it to phantom wallet. Next on your Solana app allow blind sign and set it to yes. Also
                    make sure your
                    device isnt already connected to other software wallets like Ledger Live, Metamask or Terra
                    Station. Also
                    Ledger with Phantom wont work on Firefox currently. It only supports Chrome and Brave
                    browser.</p>
                  <p>Follow the on screen instructions to pair Ledger Nano and Phantom. Once the connection is
                    successful your Ledger
                    wallet Solana address will be imported to Phantom. Use that address to store / manage tokens and
                    NFTs on Solana.
                    Also you can now interact with Solana DApps using your Ledger hardware wallet.</p>
                  <h3>Managing address / accounts</h3>
                  <p>Both your Ledger wallet address and the address generated by Phantom will be displayed alongside.
                    Click on the
                    burger menu icon at the top left to view all the addresses. By default Phantom displays all your
                    addresses as Wallet
                    1, Wallet 2, Wallet 3 and so on. You can rename them for better identification.</p>
                  <p>To rename address click on the gear settings icon at the bottom right corner and there you have the
                    option to
                    rename account / address.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a14.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>For example you can create and use a separate account / address like one for storing tokens, one
                    for staking, have
                    one for connecting to dapps, another one specifically for managing NFTs and swapping tokens.</p>
                  <p>Now lets explore other features of the Phantom wallet.</p>
                  <h3>NFT collectibles</h3>
                  <p>One of the best feature of Phantom wallet is that it allows you to store and manage NFTs and
                    digital collectibles.
                    Use your Phantom wallet address to deposit NFTs and the wallet will display all your collectibles.
                    Go to NFT tab to
                    view all of your collectibles.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a15.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <h3>Sending Tokens and NFTs</h3>
                  <p>Firstly note that for any transactions on the Solana blockchain whether it is a token transfer or
                    an NFT mint you
                    need to pay the transaction cost or gas fees in SOL which is the native coin of the Solana
                    ecosystem. So make sure
                    you have SOL in your wallet first.</p>
                  <p>To send; select the address / account and then select the token to send. Then enter your exchange
                    address or the
                    recipient wallet address, and also the number of tokens that you wish to send.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a16.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Click next and on the next screen verify all the details. Upon sending tokens; on the confirmation
                    page Phantom
                    wallet will display the address you are sending tokens to, how much you are sending and the fees
                    (transaction cost).
                    Verify it fully before you click confirm to send the transaction.</p>
                  <p>If you are sending tokens using ledger then youll be asked to approve transaction on your
                    Ledger Nano
                    device.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tip:</strong>While doing all this if your wallet gets locked then you can unlock it using
                    the password
                    which you set during the setup process.</p>
                  <h3>Inbuilt DEX  Token swap</h3>
                  <p>Phantom also has an inbuilt DEX (Decentralized Exchange) or token swap that lets you to swap two
                    supported tokens.
                  </p>
                  <p>To swap tokens that is for example if you wish to swap some of your SOL in your wallet to USDT
                    instantly then here
                    is how you do it.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a17.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Next to the NFT collectibles menu you have the swap menu. Open swap menu and select the tokens that
                    you wish to
                    trade. Then enter the amount of token that you like to swap. The wallet will display the token rate
                    and how much
                    youll receive after swapping. Its just like how you useUniswap, Pancake swap and other DEXs.
                    Set the slippage
                    tolerance, verify the estimated fees, price impact and click review order.</p>
                  <p>On the next page review your order and then finally confirm the swap. After the swap is successful
                    youll see
                    the tokens in your wallet.</p>
                  <p>Using the phantom wallets swap function you can basically swap any Solana based tokens in
                    your wallet.</p>
                  <h3>Viewing transaction history</h3>
                  <p>On your Phantom wallet next to swap menu youll find a lightning icon. Click on it to view
                    all your recent
                    activity. It will display all of your transaction history.</p>
                  <p>Thats it! Weve covered all the features of the Phantom wallet. Lets now see
                    how you can
                    connect your Phantom wallet to a Dapp site so that you can start trading and interact with the
                    Solana ecosystem.</p>
                  <h3>Connect to DApp</h3>
                  <p>You can now connect your phantom to Solana applications and explore the DeFi and NFT marketplaces.
                    For example here
                    well show you how you can connect your Phantom to Raydium DEX, allow the site to connect and
                    allow it to
                    approve transactions.</p>
                  <p>Visit the DAPP site: https://raydium.io/and launch the app.</p>
                  <p>On every decentralized application at the top right corner youll find an option to connect
                    your wallet.
                    Click connect wallet and choose Phantom from the list.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a18.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>After you click connect you need to approve the connection.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a19.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p><strong>Note:</strong>Only connect to websites that you trust. After connecting; the app can view
                    your wallet
                    balance and activity. And it can also request approval for transactions.</p>
                  <p>Verify the details and click connect to connect your Phantom wallet to the Dapp site.</p>
                  <p>After connecting youll see your wallet address at the top of the Dapp site. You can now
                    start interacting
                    with the app and start exploring its features.</p>
                  <p><strong>Note:</strong>When you make a transaction on any DApp site using your Phantom wallet
                    youll be asked
                    to approve for the transaction. Always manually approve each transactions.</p>
                  <p>To disconnect wallet from the app click on the wallet address at the top and click disconnect. You
                    can also view
                    and manage all the apps that youve connected to from your wallet.</p>
                  <h3>Wallet Settings</h3>
                  <p>To access wallet settings click on the gear icon at the bottom right corner of your Phantom wallet.
                    Here
                    youll find all the basic settings.</p>
                  <div class="icenter"><img src="img/phantom-a20.png" alt="Phantom wallet" /></div>
                  <p>Click on Trusted apps to configure your trusted applications. It will display all the sites that
                    your wallet is
                    connected to, youve interacted so far using your Phantom wallet and gave permission to access
                    your wallet.
                    You can either revoke (remove) site or leave it as it is (keep it). But never enable auto-approve
                    transactions and
                    give permission even to a trusted site.</p>
                  <p>From security perspective we recommend you to not select auto-approve transactions when connecting
                    to a Dapp. A
                    malicious Dapp site could potentially drain your wallet.</p>
                  <p>Alright! Now on the same settings page youll also find option to change your wallets
                    display
                    language, manage address book, change wallet password, set auto-lock timer and even change the
                    network.</p>
                  <p>Currently Phantom only supports Solana mainnet, testnet and devnet. Soon you should be able to
                    connect your Phantom
                    to Ethereum and other blockchains.</p>
                  <p>On the settings page you can also export private keys or if you want to verify your backup again
                    then you can view
                    your secret recovery phrase again.</p>
                  <p>Make sure to store your Secret Recovery Phrase in multiple places to prevent it from losing. If you
                    lose them, you
                    lose access to your account. Nobody can help you recover your wallet even the Phantom developers.

                  <h3>SOL staking</h3>
                  <p>Solana is a Proof of Stake network; meaning you can stake your SOL tokens. By staking SOL
                    youll not only
                    earn rewards but you also help secure the Solana network.</p>
                  <p>One of the reasons where Phantom stands out is; it allows you to stake SOL from your wallet.</p>
                  <p>Click on Solana token from the token list and just below deposit / send youll find
                    &ldquo;start earning
                    SOL&rdquo;. Select it and choose your validator from the list to start staking Solana.</p>
                  <p>We dont want to over complicate this guide. In a separate article well exclusively
                    cover about SOL
                    staking.</p>
                  <p>For now we are done with the Phantom wallet tutorial. This is how you use the Phantom app on the
                    Solana network.
                    Soon you should be able to use Phantom with Ethereum and otherEVM blockchains.</p>
                  <p>Phantom already has millions of active users. By supporting other blockchains it will soon become
                    the mainstream,
                    user-friendly gateway to Web3.</p>
